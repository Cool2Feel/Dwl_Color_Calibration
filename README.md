## 介绍(Introduction)
图像表示的均匀性是创建视频墙的重要因素，
由多个显示器组成。 但是，由于组件变化和老化，每个显示器不可避免地会产生颜色略有差异的图像
即使所有显示器中的相关设置相同，亮度和亮度也是如此。
颜色校准旨在最大程度地减少此类差异并增强图像
视频墙应用程序中所有显示器的均匀性。 通过首先测量和
比较每个显示器的色彩特性，然后用一个通用的最佳设置。
使用色彩校准，您还可以在屏幕上轻松调整每个显示器的色彩设置一台主机。

The uniformity in image representation is a vital element in creating a video wall that
consists of multiple displays. However, due to factors like component variation and
aging, it is inevitable for each display to produce images with slight differences in color
and luminance even when related settings are identical among all displays.
The Color Calibration is designed to minimize such differences and enhance the image
uniformity of all displays in a video wall application. It works by first measuring and
comparing the color characteristics of each display, and then calibrating all displays with
a common and optimal setting.
With the Color Calibration, you can also adjust color settings of each display easily on
a host computer.

### 标定目标
颜色校准通过测量，调整和同步以下设置来校准显示
### 色温
为了各种目的，有许多不同的阴影被认为是“白色”。代表白色的常见方法之一就是“色温”。色温低的白色看起来是红白色，而色温高的白色看起来有更多的蓝色。
色彩校准允许您将其他色温设置为校准目标。但是，如果所选的色温与原始色温非常不同，则必须进行较大的校正，并且最大亮度会受到影响。

### Calibration target
The Color Calibration calibrates displays by measuring, adjusting and synchronizing the following setting
### Color temperature
There are many different shades that are considered to be "white" for various purposes. One of the common methods of representing the white color is known as the "color temperature". A white color with a low color temperature appears to be reddish white, while a white color with a high color temperature appears to have more blue in it.
The Color Calibration allows you to set a different color temperature as calibration target. However, if the selected color temperature is very different from the native one, a large correction must be applied and the maximum brightness will be affected.
