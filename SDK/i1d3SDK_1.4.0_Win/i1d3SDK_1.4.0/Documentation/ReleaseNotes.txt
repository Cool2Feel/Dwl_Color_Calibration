Version History
===============

1.4.0  (2014-04-17)
-----------------

New features
  -x64 libraries for OSX + Windows

  -New measurement mode i1d3MeasModeAIO has been provided. This mode can only be used with
      firmware v2.28 and later. It provides faster and improved measuring results for all
      monitor types.

  -Added support functions for AIO mode:
    i1d3SupportsAIOMode()
    i1d3GetBacklightFreq()
    i1d3SetBacklightFreq()
    i1d3GetBacklightFreqSync()
    i1d3SetBacklightFreqSync()
  -See Application Note on "Backlight Frequency" to get to know how to make use of the new functions above.
  
  -Added new function i1d3MeasureBacklightFrequency for AIO mode capable devices to measure backlight frequency
    of devices with unstable backlight technology
    
  -Added EEPROM sanity check for EEPROM. If EEPROM is corrupted, i1d3DeviceOpen will return 
    i1d3ErrIncorrectChecksum (-513).
  
Bug fixes
  -Fixed division by zero bug in AmbientMeasure function which caused the return value of x and y to be -1.#IND.
    Now following will be retunred when measuring "perfectly black screen" : Y = 0, x = y = 1/3 (chromaticity
    coordinates for light with a flat power spectrum in terms of wavelength (equal power in every 1 nm interval)).
   
  -In case of a "perfect black" measurement, measure functions will also now return Y = 0, x = 1/3, y = 1/3
    (chromaticity coordinates for light with a flat power spectrum in terms of wavelength (equal power in every
    1 nm interval)) The reason for this change is that the SDK v1.3.7 returns Y = x = y = 0 which is not defined
    in CIE xyY color space.
  
  -Mac only: Fixed SDK time out before device responded when measuring extremely dark targets. The
    SDK would return an -523 error instead of a valid measurement.
  
Other changes
  -Added example of how to obtain firmware version to i1Display3CmdDemo
  -Added AIO mode examples to i1Display3CmdDemo and i1Display3MfcDemo
  -Added new error codes which may be returned by firmware >= 2.05 / i1D3DC devices to i1d3Status_t enumeration.
  -Streamlined Linux SDK with OSX and Windows SDKs
  -Dropped support for OS X 10.5.x
  
Known bugs
  -None

1.3.7  (2013-02-01)
-----------------
New features
  -Support for i1Display3 DirectConnect devices (i1D3DC)
  
Bug fixes
  -SDK returned devices to unprivileged users. That caused the SDK to return a -523 error
      when trying to open them.
  -Measure function returned -1.#IND for x and y values when measuring extremely dark targets.

Other changes
  -Mac only: Bundle identifier in Info.plist has changed from 'com.GretagMacbeth.i1d3SDK' to 
       'com.xrite.i1d3SDK'. If i1d3SDK bundle resources have been accessed programmaticaly by
       your application a rebuild might be necessary.
  
Known bugs
-None

1.2 (2012-10-26)
-----------------
New features
  -A new measurement mode: i1d3MeasModeBurst has been provided. This mode provides better
      accuracy on devices that have pulsing characteristics. In particular, plasma displays
      will be measured better with this mode.
  -Addition of the RG-Phosphor, Plasma and OLED support files.

Bug fixes
  -In the previous version of the SDK, setting calibration to something other than generic CMF and
      then back to Generic CMF and then querying current calibration does not accurately report
      "Generic CMF" although that calibration was correctly in effect. Now, the results of
      "GetCurrentCalibration()" are always correct.

Known bugs
  -Linux only: To build i1Display3CmdDemo with automake 1.14.* and above remove "-Werror" flag from AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
      in configure.ac
